    <textOnly>Hi
We have not yet received payment for your invoice dated [invoice-issue-date] for $[invoice-amount]
Could you please attend to this as soon as possible?
I have attached this invoice for you in case the first one was misplaced.
We would appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.
If you have any queries please feel free to contact me or your Client Manager.
Thanking you
