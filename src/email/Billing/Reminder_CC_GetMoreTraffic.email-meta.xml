    <textOnly>Hi
We have been unable to process last months/weeks management invoice on your credit card to a total of $[invoice-amount]
Have you changed your credit card recently ?
Your bank has advised us that this is due to [denial-reason]
Could you please contact me as soon as possible?
Thanking you.
