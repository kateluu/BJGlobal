Hi,

After analysing the search query reports and the quality of traffic, we are confident that a problem exists with multiple website psychology factors that are limiting the conversion of traffic . 
What I would like to suggest you consider is what we refer to as a website conversion page. These pages are designed specifically to convert high levels of traffic with a significant increase in phone calls and online enquiries. 

The common challenge we find with many clients is we can deliver high quality, high volume traffic but if your site is not geared towards conversion then achieving an ideal return on investment is very difficult.
Our experience in building website conversion pages have proven to be highly successful in the growth of hundreds of business's that we manage. Here is a link to a page I highly recommend visiting which will show examples of some successful client conversion website pages we have build: http://sponsoredlinx.com/optimisation-services/conversion-optimisation/examples/

There is usually a 1-2 week turnaround in building these pages so please let me know what you think. The cost of these conversion pages are normally $1550 however I'm happy to do this at half price for you. 
I will touch base with you soon to discuss this otherwise feel free to call me at anytime.
